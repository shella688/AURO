# Prerequisites

This code requires the transforms3d library. To download, run `git clone https://github.com/DLu/tf_transformations.git` in the src folder of the ros2 package, then `pip3 install transforms3d`. The package can then be built as normal
(If pip isn't present, run `sudo apt install python3-pip` after the first command)

# Running the code
Once the package is built, running `ros2 launch solution solution_launch.py` will launch all the relevant code
